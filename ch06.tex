FIXME: $\CONGEST$ model

\section{Exercises}

\begin{ex}[counting]
    The \emph{counting problem} $\Pi$ is defined as follows: if $N = (V,P,p)$ is a port-numbered network, then $g \in \Pi(N)$ if and only if $g(v) = |V|$ for all $v \in V$. That is, in the counting problem each node has to output the value $|V|$, i.e., it has to indicate how many nodes there are in the network.

    Design an algorithm that solves the counting problem on cycle graphs in the $\CONGEST$ model in time $O(|V|)$. Present the algorithm in a formally precise manner, using the definitions of Sections \ref{sec:pnn} and \ref{sec:distr-alg}.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[leader election]
    The \emph{leader election problem} $\Pi$ is defined as follows: if $N = (V,P,p)$ is a port-numbered network, then $g \in \Pi(N)$ if and only if there is precisely one node $u \in V$ such that
    \[
        g(v) = \begin{cases}
            1 & \text{if $v = u$}, \\
            0 & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
    \]
    Design an algorithm that solves the leader election problem on connected graphs in the $\CONGEST$ model in time $O(|V|)$.

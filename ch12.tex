\section{Exercises}

In the following exercises, we will study distributed approximation algorithms for the edge dominating set problem. We will first show that the problem is easy to approximate within factor $4$ in general graphs. Then we will have a look at some special cases, and derive tight upper and lower bounds for the approximation ratio. We use the abbreviation \emph{MEDS} for a minimum edge dominating set.

\begin{ex}[general case]\label{ex:edsfirst}
    Design a $\PN$-algorithm that finds a \Apx{4} of MEDS.
    
    \hint{Use the idea of Section~\ref{sec:vc3}. Show that the edge set $M \subseteq E$ defined in \eqref{eq:vc3-M} is a $4$-approximation of MEDS. To this end, consider an optimal solution $D^*$ and show that each edge of $D^*$ is adjacent to at most $4$ edges of~$M$.}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[\Reg{2}, upper bounds]
    Show that the following is possible in \Reg{2} graphs:
    \begin{subex}
        \item finding a \Apx{3} of MEDS in $O(1)$ time in the $\PN$ model
        \item finding a \Apx{2} of MEDS in $O(\log^* n)$ time in the $\LOCAL$ model
        \item finding a \Apx{2} of MEDS with a randomised algorithm in the $\PN$ model
    \end{subex}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[\Reg{2}, lower bounds]
    Show that the following is not possible in \Reg{2} graphs:
    \begin{subex}
        \item finding a \Apx{2.999} of MEDS in the $\PN$ model
        \item finding a \Apx{2.999} of MEDS in $O(1)$ time in the $\LOCAL$ model
    \end{subex}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[\Reg{4}, upper bound]
    Show that it is possible to find a \Apx{3.5} of MEDS in \Reg{4} graphs in constant time in the $\PN$ model.
    
    \hint{Consider an algorithm that selects all edges that have port number $1$ in at least one end. Derive an upper bound on the size of the solution and a lower bound on the size of an optimal solution, as a function of $|V|$.}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[\Reg{4}, lower bound]
    Show that it is not possible to find a \Apx{3.499} of MEDS in \Reg{4} graphs in the $\PN$ model.
    
    \hint{Use the construction of Exercise~\ref{ex:cover-four-reg}.}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[\Reg{3}, lower bound]
    Show that it is not possible to find a \Apx{2.499} of MEDS in \Reg{3} graphs in the $\PN$ model.
    
    \hint{Use the construction of Exercise~\ref{ex:cover-three-reg1}.}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[\Reg{3}, upper bound]\label{ex:edslast}
    Show that it is possible to find a \Apx{2.5} of MEDS in \Reg{3} graphs in constant time in the $\PN$ model.
    
    \hint{Let $G = (V,E)$ be a $3$-regular graph. We say that a set $D \subseteq E$ is \emph{good} if it satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $D$ is an edge cover for $G$,
        \item the subgraph induced by $D$ does not contain a path of length $3$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Put otherwise, $D$ induces a spanning subgraph that consists of node-disjoint stars. Prove that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item any good set $D$ is a \Apx{2.5} of MEDS,
        \item there is a distributed algorithm that finds a good set $D$.
    \end{enumerate}
    The distributed algorithm has to exploit the port numbers of the edges. One possible approach is this: First, use the port numbers to find nine matchings, $M_1, M_2, \dotsc, M_9$, such that each node is incident to an edge in at least one of the sets $M_i$; do not worry if some edges are present in more than one matching. Then construct an edge cover $D$ by greedily adding edges from the sets $M_i$; in step $i = 1, 2, \dotsc, 9$ you can consider all edges of $M_i$ in parallel. Finally, eliminate paths of length three by removing redundant edges in order to make $D$ a good set; again, in step $i = 1, 2, \dotsc, 9$ you can consider all edges of $M_i$ in parallel.}

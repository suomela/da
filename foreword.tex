This online textbook is an introduction to the theory of distributed algorithms. The topics covered in this course include algorithmic techniques that can be used to solve graph problems efficiently in extremely large networks, as well as fundamental impossibility results that put limitations on distributed computing.

No prior knowledge of distributed systems is needed. A basic knowledge of discrete mathematics and graph theory is assumed, as well as familiarity with the basic concepts from undergraduate-level courses on models on computation, computational complexity, and algorithms and data structures.

\paragraph{About the Course.}

This textbook was written to support the lecture course \emph{ICS-E5020 Distributed Algorithms} at Aalto University. The course is worth 5 ETCS credits. There are 12 weeks of lectures: each week there is one 2-hour lecture and one 2-hour exercise session. Each week we will cover roughly one chapter of this book.

Prior versions of this textbook have been used at the course \emph{Deterministic Distributed Algorithms}, which I lectured at the University of Helsinki in 2010, 2012, and 2014.
